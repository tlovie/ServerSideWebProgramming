# Week 4 recap so far

Last week we went through:

## PHP arrays
array -> collection of data stored as one variable

## PHP superglobals
- these are arrays that contain useful information
- usually pertaining to the request
- eg. form parameters, $_GET, $_POST, $_SESSION

## PHP arrays <=> JSON objects
- why would we want to do this?
- saving objects to files 
- transferring objects between different environments and perhaps languages
- json_encode() and json_decode()
